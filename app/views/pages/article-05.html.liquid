<h1>{{ context.page.metadata.pagetitle }}</h1>

<p>There seems to be a theme amongst my clients this year. They are recognising they can’t be experts in every aspect of their business. As a result, they are outsourcing some tasks and using experts to help them gain control and grow their business.</p> <img alt="" src="http://www.oneorangecow.com/Images/blog/img-cow-money.jpg" style="border: 0px solid; float: right; margin-left:10px;"> <h3>Will expert help be a cost or a benefit for your business?</h3> <p>Taking these steps comes with serious consideration. The most common concern stems from affordability. Using experts is an additional cost to a business so it is a wise step to consider how it could impact on the bottom line of your business.</p> <p>However, this concern should be balanced with other considerations such as:</p> <ol> <li>The real cost of doing nothing and hoping things will be better this year.</li> <li>An understanding that a business cannot expand without investment.</li> <li>An appreciation that acquiring experts to assist the business can generate increased revenue which will lead to improved nett profits.</li> <li>Recognising the greatest asset of a business is the time the business owner spends doing the important tasks for the business (e.g. planning, managing staff and/or acquiring new customers).</li> </ol> <h3>Looking for more visits and more sales, more often?</h3> <p>If you are looking for an expert to help your business achieve more visitors and more sales more often, One Orange Cow may be able to help.</p> <p>We have 2 approaches to help your business thrive.</p> <ol> <li>We can take an holistic approach by discussing marketing options for your business and examining the best alternatives to achieve your goals.</li> <li>We can assist you with specific marketing tasks such as: <ol> <li>Managing your AdWords campaigns to achieve the best results</li> <li>Providing support for your content marketing activities</li> <li>Helping you with Search Engine Optimisation for your website</li> <li>Website design</li> <li>Providing support with website updates and changes</li> </ol> </li> </ol> <h3>Make this year different!</h3> <p>So this year, spend more time doing what you are great at and less time trying to be an expert in everything.</p> <p>Whatever your marketing needs, it starts with a chat to see if we are the right fit for your business needs.
