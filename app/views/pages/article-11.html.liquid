<p>In our previous article, we discussed <a href="http://www.oneorangecow.com/online-business-growth/boost-sales-with-landing-pages-part-1">what a landing page is</a>, and why you would want one. here, we will look at how to set up a landing page.</p> <p> </p> <h2>You might be asking yourself; How do I create a landing page for my website?</h2> <p> </p> <p>This is a bigger question than you might think. There are three main considerations;</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Planning</span></li> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Design</span></li> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Technology</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <h3>Planning</h3> <p>Firstly, don&rsquo;t rush it! &nbsp;Your page should contain several key elements that will help to make it successful. A simple way to check landing page content is to run through questions a visitor would ask:</p> <ul> <li>Am I in the right place?</li> <li>Can I find the information I was looking for?</li> <li>Do I trust this site/business/person?</li> <li>Who else trusts them?</li> <li>What do I do next/where can I get more information?</li> </ul> <p>Make sure your landing page answers these 5 simple questions. This will make sure it contains everything it needs to be successful. </p> <p> </p> <p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stuck?&nbsp; </span>Trying asking these from another point of view, some people find this perspective a little easier:</p> <ul> <li>What information will visitors to this page want to know?</li> <li>What are the businesses goals for visitors to this page?</li> <li>How can we encourage visitors to take action? </li> <li>How will we measure this campaign or landing page&rsquo;s results?</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Using these questions to drive your planning will go a long way to helping you decide what your landing page should include.</p> <p> </p> <h3>Design</h3> <p>The graphic design and layout of your landing page is really important. </p> <p> </p> <p>Start by removing any elements that fail to answer one of the questions listed under planning. </p> <p> </p> <p>Keep the layout of the page simple. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <ul> <li><span style="color: #666666;">You may not need all the links from your main website.</span></li> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Don&rsquo;t assume your logo should be prominent.</span></li> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Limit distractions.</span></li> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Video introductions can be very effective, when they focus on the benefits of working with you.</span></li> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Stories are much more engaging than a list of features.</span></li> <li><span style="color: #666666;">Specialist copywriters who work on landing pages are worth every cent they charge.</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Here is a review of two landing pages:</p> <p><a href="http://www.oneorangecow.com/Images/blog/retail-business-insurance-nrma.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Click for larger image" src="http://www.oneorangecow.com/Images/blog/retail-business-insurance-nrma-250.png" style="border: 0px;" /></a>&nbsp;<a href="http://www.oneorangecow.com/Images/blog/retail-business-insurance-smart.png" target="_blank"><img alt="Click for larger image" src="http://www.oneorangecow.com/Images/blog/retail-business-insurance-smart-250.png" style="border: 0px;" /></a></p> <p> </p> <h3>Technology</h3> <p>The way your current website is built will affect the technical &lsquo;how&rsquo; to add a page to your website. Generally landing pages are still on your main website, but often they are not available via the menu structure of your website. </p> <p> </p> <p>In some cases it may be better to have a separate domain name, particularly for magazine, newspaper, radio or TV advertising. This allows you to have a more simple (easier to type and remember) word or domain in your advert.&nbsp; </p> <p> </p> <p>As for adding a page to your site, you will need to discuss with your website manager or web designer.</p> <p>I hope you have enjoyed this article. I'll be rounding out this article next week by looking at ways you can test the success of your landing pages.</p>
