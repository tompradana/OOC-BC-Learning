<h1>{{ context.page.metadata.pagetitle }}</h1>

<p>Have you ever wondered what would happen if you changed the picture or the text on a webpage? Would you get more sales or leads? One of the best features of landing pages is the relative ease with which you can test different elements of your design and content. &nbsp;</p> <p>This is Part Three in a series of articles about Landing Pages. You can read <a href="http://www.oneorangecow.com/online-business-growth/boost-sales-with-landing-pages-part-1">Landing pages Introduction</a>&nbsp;and <a href="http://www.oneorangecow.com/online-business-growth/boost-sales-with-landing-pages-part-2">Planning and Building a Landing page</a>&nbsp;if you haven't already,</p> <div>This allows you to see which changes make the biggest difference to your lead generation or sales. At the most basic level, you can use a service from Google called &lsquo;Content Experiments&rsquo; and do tests in real time, of two or more different versions of the one page. &nbsp;The basic premise is shown in the image below:</span><br /> </div> <div><img alt="Split testing example" src="http://www.oneorangecow.com/Images/blog/split-testing.jpg" /><br /> <br /> </div> <div>&nbsp;So, when your sales team is arguing with the marketing department about a new change, let the data settle the argument.&nbsp;</div> <div><br /> </div> <h3>&nbsp;What to test?</h3> <div>Anything can be changed in each version of a page.&nbsp; There are two types of tests we run;&nbsp;</div> <div>Sweeping changes, where each version is completely different.</div> <div>Minor element changes.&nbsp;</div> <div><br /> </div> <div>Sweeping changes are used usually earlier in a new campaign, or if there is a change in the targeted advertising. Here we are seeking a concept, which converts much better than another design. Minor changes are usually used when we are looking for smaller increases, to an already successful design.&nbsp;</div> <div><br /> </div> <h3>&nbsp;How long should I run a test?</h3> <div>&nbsp;The answer to this will vary with every person you speak to. My answer is look for a &lsquo;statistically significant&rsquo; volume of new visitors. For example, if your site currently receives ten thousand visitors per day, you might want 10% of your daily visitors to see each version.&nbsp; Or if your site receives 1000 visitors per month, then you will have to wait longer, and perhaps be satisfied with 100 visitors per page you are testing.&nbsp;</div> <div><br /> </div> <div>&nbsp;So now you have a good basis for understanding what a landing page is, the process to build your landing pages, and the method by which you can get better results.
