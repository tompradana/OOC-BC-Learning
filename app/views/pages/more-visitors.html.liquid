  Many companies and website owners focus all their efforts on this one puzzle piece. In my opinion, this is to their detriment, as there are other important

<p>
  This one puzzle piece has a huge variety of options open to the website owner. <a href="/consulting/tools-of-the-trade.html">Most of our Tools</a> are focused on this area, it is that important.</p>
<h2>1. On-site Content </h2>
<p>
  This comes in the form of Articles, Videos, Images, and obviously your Services and/or Product descriptions. </p>
<p>
  Each of these should also be attached to your business social media presence, and where possible to other sites. Your business’ social media is an
  extension of your On-site content.</p>
<h2>2. External Content </h2>
<p>
  External content we define as other websites writing about your business, including Articles, Videos, Images, and again, your Services and/or Product descriptions.</p>
