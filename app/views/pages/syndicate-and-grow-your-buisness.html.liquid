<p>Search engines love content. When you add blog posts, articles and white papers to your website you can improve your search engine ranking, drive traffic to your site and promote your expertise.</p> <p>But don&rsquo;t limit the promotion of your content to your website. By syndicating your new content, you can increase visits to your website and build your reputation as an authority in your field.</p> <p>Syndicating your content can also introduce you to new potential clients who may visit your website or contact you because of your expertise.</p> <h2>So how do you syndicate your new content?</h2> <img src="http://www.oneorangecow.com/Images/blog/syndicate-articles.png" style="border: 0px solid; width: 200px; height: 199px; float: right; margin-left: 4px;" alt="Where to Syndicate Articles" /><p><strong>1.	Email your database</strong><br /> Your list of past, present and potential clients is a valuable marketing resource. Sending them interesting and informative articles with a link to your website will help build customer loyalty. It will also keep you top of mind for the next time they need your products or services.</p> <p><strong>2.	Find a friend</strong><br /> Some industries are natural partners e.g. fitness instructors and dieticians, graphic designers and printers. Look for complimentary (not competing) businesses and offer to write regular educational articles for their client newsletters for free if they allow you to include a link to your website. Be prepared to reciprocate by allowing them to write articles to send to your clients.</p> <p><strong>3.	Use your social media connections</strong><br /> You probably have connections on social media platforms such as LinkedIn, Facebook and Twitter. Use these contacts to promote your latest article or blog post and include a link back to your website. If your content is interesting and informative, they may share it with their connections boosting visits to your website and building your reputation as an expert.</p> <p><strong>4.	Use external services to promote your content</strong><br /> There are websites that specialise in promoting blog posts, articles and media releases such as www.prnutshell.com. You simply post a summary of your new article or blog to their website with a link to your own. The search engines may choose to see the link, follow it to your site and note you have new content. This can build your website&rsquo;s ranking - driving more traffic to your site.</p> <p>-- </p> <p>There are lots of ways to increase the sales generated by your website.
