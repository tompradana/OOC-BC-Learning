<p>Working with an online marketing consultant will help your business make the transition from a site that draws high traffic to a site that pulls excellent conversion rates. </p> <p>While driving traffic is important part of an overall digital marketing strategy, it only accounts for the first half of the buyer’s experience. The second half is all about the design of your website – how easy it is to navigate through the pages, and how it feels to spend time reading about your product or service.</p> <p>The point is this: you can drive 100,000 people to your website and still record low sales numbers because your conversion rate hovers around 0.2 or worse. All those terms about driving traffic to your site do not account for the most important metric of all: conversion rates.</p> <p>What is conversion rate, exactly?</p> <p>Conversion rate falls into this category. <a href="https://www.wordstream.com/conversion-rate" target="_blank">Conversion rate</a> is the number of visitors to your site who complete a desired goal. &nbsp;It exists at the end of a marketing strategy designed to improve X, Y, or Z about a company. Common pursuits are to increase brand awareness, build up a large email database, get referrals from past customers, buying product X from your website &hellip; essentially anything that asks searchers to perform a specific thing. </p> <p>The first component of a marketing strategy is to develop the traffic, which entails a variety of outreach initiatives and lead-generation strategies. The second component is guiding the visitor through the buyers’ experience and ultimately generating a high conversion rate. </p> <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="/Images/blog/img-The-Importance-of-Websites-that-Convert-Visitors-to-Customers2.jpg"> </p> <h3>The Importance of User Experience (UX) in Conversion Ratings</h3> <p>User experience is something that web designers and business owners need to think hard about. Thinking hard about UX is what makes a website excel at conversions because it adapts to visitor intent and does so in a visually stimulating way. </p> <p>Here are some features of a conversion-primed website offering great user experience:</p> <ul> <li><strong>A Visual Treat</strong>. Interactive websites are more important now than ever. You cannot put up a bland WordPress site and expect first-time visitors to feel excitement and curiosity about what you offer. The primary focus on the visual domain must be <a href="https://www.usability.gov/what-and-why/visual-design.html" target="_blank">on inter-connectivity</a> of the colours and shapes on the site. If there is any visual disharmony, then users will quickly feel uncomfortable and lose interest. A visual treat could also mean incorporating more video into product description, which, <a href="https://www.digitalcommerce360.com/2011/03/07/product-videos-raise-purchase-likelihood-stacks-and-stacks/" target="_blank">research</a> has shown, has the potential to increase your conversion rates by 144%. </li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Easy to Navigate.</strong> A site with a clear layout is also fundamental to driving conversions. The site hierarchy is really structured around your specific statement of intent – what it is your company does, and how exactly you do it. Both the layout and the statement of intent need to be crystal clear and intuitive, which means <a href="https://optinmonster.com/11-web-design-principles-that-will-boost-your-conversion-rate/" target="_blank">making decisions</a> about having a scroll down menu or a navigation bar that jumps to pages, to give just one example.</li> </ul> <ul> <li><strong>Full of Insightful Information</strong>. The more unique information you have on your site, the more people will want to read and learn. People want exposure to expertise, and when they land on your site you have a small window to impress. You can include a call-to-action on your site once there is enough information to really get people thinking. It is all about the hook, line, and sinker in guiding the buyers experience on a site.</li> </ul> <h3>Rounding It Up</h3> <p><a href="http://www.oneorangecow.com/">Online marketing consultants</a> know how to get the best bang for your website buck by dovetailing a search strategy with a conversion strategy. Letting an expert do all the hard work of incorporating principles of great user experience into your site will bring the right visitors and a great conversion rate directly to your business.</p> <meta name="keywords" content="online marketing consultants">
